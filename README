pyrancid
========

A easy to setup rancid-type config tracker in python

Currently working:
    - ssh, telnet, and raw access
    - command execution, storage, and diffing
    - change emailing

Still to do:
    - significant code cleanup
    - handle things like alert groups and per-machine
        mail lists
    - deal with file io errors more robustly
    - test on more platforms
